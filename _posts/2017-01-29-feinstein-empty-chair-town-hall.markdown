We would like to welcome all members of all the Indivisible groups through the state of Indiana to a conference call on July 2nd, 2017 at 7pm Central / 8 pm Eastern. 

This call will be a time for all the groups around the state to let everyone know how they are resisting the Trump agenda. 

We will also have numerous updates regarding all the action items the Indivisible Hoosiers state group is currently working on. 

Please email us for the dial-in telephone number. 

Thanks! #StandINdivisble
