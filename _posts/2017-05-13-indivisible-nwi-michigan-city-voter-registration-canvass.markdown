On May 13, 2017 Indivisible Northwest Indiana held a successful voter registration training and canvass in Michigan City, IN. This was an important event for this young group as most of the volunteers had never participated in voter registration before. The members gained valuable experience and are holding their next voter registration training on Saturday August 12, 2017. Please visit the calendar page for more information and if you are interested in coming for the training.
