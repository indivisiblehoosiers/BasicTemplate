  PHONE SENATOR YOUNG’S OFFICE


  SENATOR YOUNG'S CALL SCRIPT
  “Hello, this is ________ and my address is _________. I am calling to express my disappointment that Senator Young has not yet spoken out against the BCRA. This bill harms our most vulnerable Hoosiers, specifically the poor, disabled and elderly through its harmful cuts to Medicaid, decreased support for subsidies, and essential health benefits, which will raise premiums. For many years, Republicans have claimed that the ACA was making healthcare unaffordable, but the Senate has crafted a bill that has put healthcare out of reach for even more people, threatens the quality of life of Hoosiers, and will lead to preventable deaths. This is unacceptable. We demand a healthcare bill that preserves essential health benefits, continues the
  Medicaid expansion, and works to make healthcare more affordable to even more people, not a tax cut for millionaires masquerading as a healthcare bill. I urge Senator Young to do the right thing for Hoosiers and come out against the BCRA. I would appreciate a response to my request. Thank you.”

  Office phone numbers:
  Indianapolis (317) 226-6700
  New Albany (812) 542-4820
  Washington, D.C. (202) 224-5623

Friends, the GOP pulled the vote on the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA) last week, but we are not out of the woods yet. Please join Indivisible groups across the state in calling Senator Todd Young and Governor Holcomb, neither of whom have taken a position on this bill. Remember that the BCRA takes an ax to Medicaid, and not just the expansion, but the entire program. This bill is an excuse to cut taxes for the wealthy at the expense of the rest of Americans, including poor children and disabled Hoosiers.
