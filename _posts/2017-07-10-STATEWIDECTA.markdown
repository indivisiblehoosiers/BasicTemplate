> Indivisible Hoosiers STATEWIDE CTA July 10 - 14, 2017
> Trumpcare Cuts to Medicaid


Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is NOT giving up on bringing the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA) to the Senate floor for a vote. He is pulling every rabbit out of his leadership hat in an effort to get the 50 votes he needs to pass the BCRA. (He’s counting on Mike Pence to be the much needed 51st vote - and he’ll get it.)
Indivisible Hoosiers has been working diligently to let Senator Todd Young know that the BCRA is unacceptable, cruel and will hurt many Hoosiers. This week, we’re concentrating on the draconian cuts to Medicaid that McConnell, Ryan and others plan to use to finance their WealthCare tax cuts for the richest Americans.
Here are some facts to help you craft your call to Senator Todd Young’s office as you ask him to vote NO on the BCRA.

* Indiana’s Medicaid program provides coverage for one in five Hoosiers, including more than 600,000 children and pregnant women.

* Half of Indiana births are paid for through Medicaid

* Medicaid and CHIP (Children’s Health Insurance Program) enrollments in Indiana, under the ACA, increased by 33%. The Senate GOP cuts to Medicaid would take coverage away from many, if not most, of those.

* Medicaid provides health insurances to almost 13,000 Hoosier Veterans.

* Medicaid is the primary medical provider program currently fighting the opioid epidemic in our country.

* As a Medicaid expansion state, Indiana may be one of the hardest hit states under this current Senate Trumpcare plan.

* Medicaid cuts will reduce services and close many small, rural hospitals in Indiana, limiting coverage for Hoosiers and costing jobs.

* Indiana currently spends about $2 billion in general funds annually for Medicaid, but this helps leverage another $8 billion in federal funding. These are real dollars that support above-average wages in the healthcare industry which are then spent in local businesses, supporting thousands of jobs statewide.
  

* When you contact Sen. Young’s offices, be sure to give your name and where you live in Indiana so your call will be tracked.

  Suggested activities for the week:
  Monday, July 10 - Call Senator Young’s office and tell him that Medicaid cuts will devastate the most vulnerable Hoosiers. (Bonus points for calling all his offices.)

  
  Tuesday, July 11 - Email Sen. Young (https://www.young.senate.gov/content/contact-senator) and share the same info from your call yesterday.

  
  Wednesday, July 12 - Call Senator Young’s office again and share the story of someone you know / love who benefits from Medicaid. Maybe it’s a child in special ed, a child with disabilities, a relative in nursing home care, a recipient of Medicaid insurance. Share a story. If you don’t have one, ask someone for their story.

  
  Thursday, July 13 - Contact your Representative. If they’re Republican, let them know your feelings about the Senate bill, your disappointment in their support of the House bill (that passed!) and that you are watching their stance on healthcare. Also call Senator Donnelly, (202) 224-4814, and thank him for taking a bold stand to call Trumpcare a pending disaster.

  
  Friday, July 14 - Leave a note on Sen. Young’s FB page (you may have to leave a comment on his posts) letting him know how harmful Trumpcare will be for Hoosiers. Urge him to come out, publicly, against BCRA.

  
  Saturday, July 15 - If you feel like it, Tweet or Facebook Sen. Young and share your concern one more time. Then spend the day with family or friends. Take a long nap. Read a book. Watch a movie. Self-care is resistance, too!
