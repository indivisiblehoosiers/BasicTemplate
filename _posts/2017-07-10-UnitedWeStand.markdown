> Indivisible is hosting Evansville groups, working to advocate for change. We currently have 14 groups joining us that will have a representative who will provide information about what the group does, events that the group is involved in and how you could get involved. In addition, we will highlight a new website, Southwest Indiana Partnership Action Network (SWINPAN) that helps people connect to local groups of interest. This event will be fun, family friendly, and informative. Please join us!
