> ### Come hang out with progressives in District 2 and learn about what Indivisible teams are doing! Plus, we'll have some free food. Come eat, drink, and vent about politics with like-minded folks! And if you want to help support events like this in the future, feel free to bring us a small donation. Oh and make sure to invite your friends!
