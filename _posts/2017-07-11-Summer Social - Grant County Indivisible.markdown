Grant County: Indivisible invites YOU to our Summer Social!\
\
We will have food to share (including vegan options), and cold drinks too.\
\
Come out and have good conversation with friendly local people who are working together to create change and resist harmful social and political agendas that affect us all.\
\
We want to hear from YOU what is important to you and your family. Whether you realize it or not, politics affects almost every aspect of our lives in one way or another. Some of the topics our group is focused on right now include health care, the economy, environmental issues, civil rights, immigration, voter rights, and the 2018 election. Come out and meet some new friends, and find out how you can bea part of the change!\
\
Some seating is available, but feel free to bring lawn chairs / blankets to relax! All ages welcome. There is a playground nearby, and you are welcome to bring other activities for the young (and young at heart) — but one of the main activities will be getting to know each other and hearing about important topics that affect our lives, and learning how we can be a part of the change.\

ABOUT US:\
\
Grant County: Indivisible's Principles:\
\
\*Donald Trump’s agenda will take America backwards, and it must be stopped\
\*To work together to achieve this goal, we must model the values of inclusion, respect, and fairness\
\
Our Purpose:\
\
The purpose of this group is to enable the residents of Grant County to work together to resist racism, homophobia, anti-immigrant actions, sexism and bigotry of all kinds. Our goal is to support a progressive political agenda that will help all Americans achieve the rights and quality of life that we all deserve.\
\
Our Action Plan:\
\
We focus on local meetings and calls to action, emphasizing grassroots advocacy in coordination with the national Indivisible movement and the statewide Indivisible Hoosiers team. We know that not everyone has the time or inclination for every event, but we encourage people to participate in as many activities as they can.
